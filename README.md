# Result Analysis Dashboard – SACI 2024/2025  

## 1. Project Objective  
The goal of this project is to **analyze and visualize student performance data** across different levels (Primary, JSS, and Secondary) and subjects for SACI in the 2024/2025 academic year.  
The dashboard provides insights into:  
- Overall performance  
- Subject-level strengths and weaknesses  
- Student improvement trends  
- Term-by-term comparisons  

This enables school administrators and educators to make **data-driven decisions** that enhance teaching and learning outcomes.

## 2. Dataset Details  
- **Source**: SACI school records (academic performance dataset)  
- **Scope**: Covers student scores across **multiple departments (Arts, Science, General)** and across **1st and 2nd terms**.  
- **Features**:  
  - Student names  
  - Subject scores  
  - Term (1st vs 2nd)  
  - Department & Level classification  

---

## 3. Tools Used  
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **Power Query Editor** – Data transformation and modeling  
- **Pivot Tables** – Aggregation and analysis  
- **Excel Charts/Visualization Tools** – Interactive dashboard building

## 4. Analysis Workflow  
1. **Data Cleaning** – Removed inconsistencies and missing values  
2. **Transformation** – Structured dataset into subject-wise and student-wise performance  
3. **Modeling** – Grouped data by department, level, and term  
4. **Visualization** – Created charts to track:  
   - Overall performance  
   - Best and worst subjects  
   - Student improvement trends  
   - Term-by-term comparisons  

---

## 5. Key Insights  
- **Overall Average Score**: *44.8* (indicating room for academic improvement)  
- **Best Performing Subject**: *Government* with an average of **76.7**  
- **Least Performing Subject**: *Islamic Studies* with an average of **3.8**  
- **Student Improvement**: Some students demonstrated steady growth between terms, while others showed performance gaps  
- **Subject Performance per Term**: Certain subjects showed consistent improvement, while others declined in the second term  

---

## 6. Visualization  
The interactive dashboard highlights:  
- **Average student performance per subject**  
- **Comparison of 1st vs 2nd term scores**  
- **Department and level-wise filtering**  
- **Trend analysis of student improvement**  

---

## 7. Recommendations  
- **Targeted Support**: Provide extra coaching for low-performing subjects (e.g., Islamic Studies)  
- **Leverage Strengths**: Reinforce teaching methods in subjects like Government, where students excel  
- **Student-specific Interventions**: Monitor students with declining performance and provide personalized academic support  
- **Curriculum Adjustment**: Review teaching strategies and materials for subjects with low average scores  
## 8. Limitation and Next Steps  

### Limitations  
- Dataset limited to **two academic terms**; may not capture long-term performance trends  
- External factors affecting student performance (attendance, socio-economic background, teaching quality) not included  

### Next Steps  
- Incorporate **multi-year academic data** for trend analysis  
- Add **demographic insights** (gender, age group, etc.) for deeper performance breakdown  
- Build a **Power BI version** for richer interactivity and advanced drill-through analysis
